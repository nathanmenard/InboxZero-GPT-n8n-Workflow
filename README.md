# Installation Guide


## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Get GPT API Key
- Go to [OpenAI's signup page](https://platform.openai.com).
- Complete the signup process and obtain your GPT API key.
- Save this API key, as you'll need it to configure the n8n workflow.

### 2. Get Gmail OAuth for n8n
- Visit the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
- Create a new project and navigate to "Credentials".
- Enable the Gmail API and configure OAuth consent screen.
- Download the JSON file which includes your OAuth 2.0 Client IDs and Client Secret.
- Store these credentials safely for later use in n8n.

### 3. Create n8n Account
- Sign up for an n8n account [here](https://n8n.io/?ref=nzyxngm&utm_source=affiliate).
- Once registered, install the n8n software according to their documentation.

### 4. Initial n8n Setup
- Open n8n and initiate a new workflow.
- Replace placeholder values in the first set of nodes with your GPT API key and Gmail OAuth credentials.

### 5. Activate Shortcuts for Inbox Zero (Azerty French Version)
- In Gmail settings, go to "See all settings".
- Go to "Keyboard shortcuts" and configure them as follows (French AZERTY layout):
    - Archive: `e`
    - Answer all: `a`
    - Answer: `r`
    - Label: `l`
    - Navigate Emails: `j` and `k`

### 6. Get Gmail Label IDs for n8n
- In Gmail, right-click on a label and select "Label color" then "Label code".
- Copy the label IDs for each label you want to use.
- Add these IDs to the respective Gmail nodes in your n8n workflow.

### 7. Gmail Inbox Setup
- Create or rename labels in Gmail as follows:
    1. `noActionNeeded`
    2. `interestingNews`
    3. `importantInfo`
    4. `needsResponse`
- Update the Gmail nodes in n8n to use these label IDs for sorting.

### 8. Testing the Workflow
- In the Gmail node titled "Gmail_GetEmailOverviews" in n8n, set the limit to 5-10 emails.
- Run the workflow in n8n to ensure it sorts and labels emails as expected.

### 9. Run it Full
- Once testing is successful, remove or adjust the email limit in "Gmail_GetEmailOverviews".
- Execute the workflow to sort your full inbox.
